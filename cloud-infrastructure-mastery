Project: Enterprise AI Knowledge Assistant (RAG Architecture)
1. Executive Summary
In large-scale IT operations, Service Desk efficiency is often throttled by manual knowledge retrieval. This project implements a private, secure, and scalable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistant designed to automate Tier 1 support queries using internal Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).

2. The Problem Statement
Knowledge Silos: Documentation is scattered across PDFs, Wikis, and SharePoint.

Support Latency: Average MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery) is inflated by 30% due to manual information lookups.

Operational Cost: High volume of repetitive "How-to" tickets consumes expensive engineering resources.

3. The Solution: "IT Knowledge Assistant"
A secure AWS-native AI agent that allows employees to query internal documentation using Natural Language. Unlike public AI, this data stays within the enterprise VPC boundaries, ensuring compliance with GDPR/ISO standards.

4. Strategic Business Value (The "Why")
📉 30% Reduction in Ticket Volume: Automating routine queries frees up senior engineers for high-value transformation work.

⏱️ Instant Knowledge Access: Reduces search time from minutes to seconds, improving organizational productivity.

🔒 Data Sovereignty: Implementation uses Amazon Bedrock with Private VPC Endpoints, ensuring enterprise data is never used to train public models.

💰 Cost Optimization: By leveraging a Serverless AI architecture, the system only incurs costs when used, providing a high ROI compared to dedicated support staff.

5. Technical Pillars
Infrastructure: Multi-AZ VPC, Private Subnets, S3-to-Bedrock Private Link.

Automation: 100% Infrastructure as Code (Terraform).

Intelligence: RAG pattern using Vector Embeddings for high-accuracy retrieval.
